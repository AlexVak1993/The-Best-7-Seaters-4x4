        <h1>The Best 7&nbspSeater&nbsp4x4s</h1>
        <p>Until quite recently, if you wanted to head out into the rough, you’d have to do so in a boxy, uncomfortable
          (though practical) 4x4. And if you wanted to venture out with more than 4 other passengers, you’d find
          yourself
          in a less than glamorous MPV or minibus, with limited capability.
        <p> Not any more! Now you can combine 7 seater functionality with the power of all-wheel-drive, wrapped up in a
          comfortable, stylish SUV. From the school run to an outdoor adventure, these skillful beasts will help you and
          your family or friends to handle any terrain, with bucket-loads of space and excellent towing capacity to
          enjoy
          along the way.
        </p>
        <p> There’s a huge choice of SUVs on the car market so, which are the best 7 seater 4x4s? Here are 5 of our
          favourites…</p>

        <p>The <a href="#">SEAT Tarraco</a> - SEAT’s largest SUV - adds a little sparkle to 7 seater 4x4 options, thanks
          to its sporty
          styling and a range of beautiful metallic paints, available at no extra cost.
        </p>
        <p> Inside, there’s a choice of fabric, leatherette or leather upholstery and adjustable sport seats to keep you
          comfortable along the way. Features like Park Assist, Virtual Pedal and Keyless entry provide effortless
          manoeuvring and loading.
        </p>
        <p> 7 seats come as standard, although the more compact rear seats may be better suited to children than adults.
          The SEAT Tarraco is easy to handle around town and with 4Drive option on the largest 2.0-litre engine, it’s a
          real city to country car.</p>

          Gargantuan dimensions mean that there’s simply no way you wouldn't have enough room in the <a href="#">Land
            Rover
            Discovery</a> - whether carrying luggage or passengers. Even the third row of seats offers plenty of room
          for legs
          and heads with everyone taking advantage of luxuriously appointed leather seats.
        </p>
        <p>Off-roading is what Land Rovers do best, and with all-wheel-drive as standard on every Discovery model you’ll
          be hard pushed to find anything that this expertly equipped 4x4 can’t tackle with ease and in style.
        </p>
        <p>An excellent wading depth of 900mm means it can be a little more adventurous than other SUVs while superb
          towing capacity makes it ideal for pulling along caravans, trailers or horse boxes, too.

          Whether in standard 5 seat or Allspace 7 seat format, the <a href="#">Volkswagen Tiguan</a> has proven to be
          another 4x4 hit.
          Four-wheel-drive is available in the form of VW’s capable 4Motion in conjunction with the automatic 2.0 litre
          diesel engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ergonomic dashboard is laid out in a logical fashion, putting everything within easy reach in a cabin that
          boasts the usual solid, VW quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ambient lighting and optional panoramic tilt and slide roof provide an even more spacious feel to the interior
          while Traffic Sign Recognition, Adaptive Cruise Control, Traffic Jam Assist and Lane Assist allow you sit back
          and take it all in.

        <p> The Honda CR-V’s full title of Comfortable Runabout Vehicle is emphasised by the plush interior and good
          suspension, while a lighter weight, more responsive steering and aerodynamic body shape of the newest
          generation makes handling a breeze.
